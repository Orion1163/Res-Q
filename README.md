ResQ - Traffic Police Credential Management System <br><br>
Description<br><br>
ResQ is a web application built using React.js and Firebase, designed to streamline the management of traffic police officers' credentials. It allows police commissioners to securely insert email IDs and passwords of traffic police officers into the system. These credentials are stored in Firebase Firestore and can be fetched by the application for officer authentication purposes. The application also features a dashboard for police commissioners to view and manage traffic police officer credentials.

Note: This project is just one phase of the whole environment created for the ambulance driver to find the path using the app.
<br><br>
The larger environment involves the development of an Emergency Response System (ERS) aimed at optimizing emergency medical services (EMS) by facilitating efficient navigation and response during critical situations. ERS integrates real-time data and predictive analytics to minimize response times and maximize patient outcomes. ResQ serves as a component within the ERS ecosystem, focusing specifically on managing traffic police officer credentials to ensure smooth coordination and communication between emergency responders.
